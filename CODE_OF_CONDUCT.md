# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for all participants. We pledge to honor and support everyone who engages with our community, whether by reporting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing constructive feedback, or participating in discussions.

Communication across all channels (including GitHub, mailing lists, Twitter, etc.) should always be constructive. We will not tolerate personal attacks, trolling, harassment (public or private), insults, or any form of unprofessional behavior.

We strive to treat all individuals with courtesy and respect, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect all participants in this project to uphold these values.

If any member of our community violates this Code of Conduct, project maintainers may take appropriate action, which could include removing issues, comments, or pull requests, or blocking accounts as necessary.

If you experience or witness any unacceptable behavior, or if you have any concerns, please reach out to us.

We welcome suggestions for improving this Code of Conduct. Feel free to submit an issue or pull request with your ideas.
