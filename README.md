# Introducing Kabballa: PHP-FPM for UNA Applications Deployment

This application is part of a larger platform called **Kabballa**. Kabballa is a cutting-edge application designed to streamline the management and deployment of modern, scalable infrastructures. This platform supports a wide array of technologies, including MySQL, Redis, Nginx, PHP, Golang, Vite, Node.js, Memcached, Elasticsearch, and more. Leveraging the power of Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker Swarm, it provides an efficient way to host and orchestrate applications across multiple environments. Soon, Kabballa will become open source, inviting the community to contribute and innovate.
